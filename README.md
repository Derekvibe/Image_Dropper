The site is made for dragging, dropping and uploading images. 
Firebase was used as the Authentication method which is used to sign in, log in and sign out a user. 

for the sign in, an account has already been signed in in the firebase authentication data base so majorly we just have to login with the already signed in data. 

email: user@example.com
password: 1Password

once you have loged in, it displays another page where the drag and drop will be perfomed. in the DragBox whenever an image is dragged into it gives a little transition animation. 

The images being dragged into the DragBox are displayed below the box and they is an option to delete image
